We’re excited to announce that the new policies for [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/) are now live\! These policies—[Terms of Service](https://rubygems.org/policies/terms-of-service), [Privacy Notice](https://rubygems.org/policies/privacy), [Acceptable Use Policy](https://rubygems.org/policies/acceptable-use), and [Copyright Policy](https://rubygems.org/policies/copyright)—help bring clarity and transparency to how RubyGems.org operates and how we protect the platform and its users.

Originally introduced for community review in March, these policies officially took effect on **June 30, 2025**. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback submitted during the preview period via email and Slack—your input helped refine these documents to better serve the needs of the Ruby community.

To ensure all users are informed and aligned with these updates, **returning users will now see a banner prompting them to review and accept the new policies** upon logging in.

We invite everyone to [read the finalized policies](https://rubygems.org/policies) and continue to share feedback. Thank you for being a part of this effort to keep the Ruby ecosystem safe, respectful, and open to all.
